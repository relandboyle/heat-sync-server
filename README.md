HeatSync integrates with network-connected temperature sensors to generate time-series data which can be displayed or reported in various ways.

Inspired by the New York City Worst Landlord Watchlist and the Special Enforcement Program, used to hold landlords accountable if they fail to meet their legal obligations.

NYC landlords are required to provide heat to tenants between October 1st and May 31st. Overnight (10pm to 6am) the indoor temperature must be kept to a minimum 62F. In the daytime (6am to 10pm) if the outside temperature is 55F or lower, then the indoor temperature must be kept to a minimum 68F.

A common problem in rent-stabilized apartment units is a lack of heat and hot water during the cold months. If the heat or hot water is disabled and tenants report the condition to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), inspectors will typically visit the building 3-5 days later. By that time, the heat or hot water has likely been restored, and no violation can be issued to the landlord.

This systemic failure on the part of HPD and NYC can be partially offset if the tenants of a given building are able to organize and keep accurate records of the temperature in their apartment units throughout the winter season. However, it is challenging for tenants to execute consistently.

HeatSync addresses the problem by automating the process of collecting consistent, accurate temperature data from any number of apartment units. As buildings and apartment units are onboarded, the application automatically adapts and flexibly reports on the new locations.

The HeatSync Client application allows a tenant to view and export the raw data from their own sensor. Additionally, a lawyer representing a building's tenants may manually onboard a new building or add apartments to the database. At this time, sensor onboarding must be completed in-person by the owner of the UbiBot sensor account.
